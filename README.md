# ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm @anyonmus1

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a hands-on developer and builder passionate about creating useful, real-world tech â€” from intelligent automation to high-performance gaming PCs.

### What I'm Into:
- **AI & Automation**: Exploring small open-source LLMs, reflective AI systems, and automating meaningful tasks.
- **Web & Blockchain**: Building full-stack web apps, dApps, and experimenting with web3, smart contracts, and crypto systems.
- **Systems & Hardware**: Love building custom PCs (both for gaming and AI dev), optimizing performance, and working close to the metal.
- **Side Projects & Scaling**: I'm also into affiliate marketing, passive income models, and turning smart side projects into real growth.

### Currently Learning:
- **AI Agents & Tool Use**: Reflective training, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and building modular AI systems.
- **Next.js & Tailwind**: Still using these for rapid front-end dev.
- **Rust & Solana**: Digging deeper into fast, secure blockchain dev.

### Looking to Collaborate On:
- Modular AI assistants and crypto trading tools
- Web3 integrations and smart contract systems
- Open-source AI tools that make tech more accessible

### How to Reach Me:
- **Email**: chiltonjaden@gmail.com
