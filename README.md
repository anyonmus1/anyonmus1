- 👋 Hi, I’m @anyonmus1
- 👀 I’m interested in building web applications, web3 technology, blockchain technology, and smart contracts.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning game development, Next.js, rust for solona, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and working with blockchain technologies like Solidity.
- 📝 I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects, web development, and blockchain-based applications.
- 📫 How to reach me Feel free to reach out via email me at chiltonjaden@gmail.com.
- ⚡ Fun fact: Dismantled and rebuilt my first computer at age 12 (miraculously it worked!), and by 15 I was trying to mine Bitcoin using Python scripts on my laptop - though all I managed to do was overheat it! Now I build dApps and smart contracts, but I'll never forget the excitement of those first tech experiments.
